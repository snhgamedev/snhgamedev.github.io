## What is the SNH-GAMEDEV Meetup?

We are a group of people who **share our interest in making video games**. 

The group's mission is scoped as follows:

* It's **specifically for video games.** Other game-like activities off-topic unless they are also applicable to making video games in some way. For example, board games share psychology and mechanics with video games, but board games themselves would be considered off-topic.
* It's for people **making a video game in ANY role** at any level of contribution, including distribution and marketing.
* It's for people **at any level**, from the beginning game maker to the seasoned publisher running a game-related business.
* It's where people **talk about what they are making**.
* It's where people **find other people to collaborate with**.
* It's where people **find others doing things locally for mutual inspiration**.
* It's where people **form a community** around sharing their knowledge and excitement about making video games.

Our cultural values:

* We celebrate making games, spreading knowledge and excitement, and adding more community for game makers in Southern New Hampshire.
* We want to support a positive and welcoming environment where person-to-person connections can develop over time.
* We believe in tolerance and acceptance of diversity.
