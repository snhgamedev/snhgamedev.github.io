## Participating in the Group

We welcome all levels of skill and interest! You just have to be curious about making games and sharing your interests with the group.
Our meetings are roughly structured into two parts.

#### Part I: Quickie Standup-style Greetings

This helps members old and new get to know you! The idea is to give everyone a chance to say something before getting deep into the details. 

Here's some suggested things to mention if you're new.

* What's your name?
* What's your background and/or interest in video games?
* What are you working on/learning?

If you're meeting with us again, then share some of what you've been up.

* **Do you have anything to demo in Part II of the meeting?**
* Any progress have you made since the last meeting to share?
* Are you looking for help, information, collaboration, anything?

For admins, it's helpful for use to get feedback from you as well!

* How did you find the group?
* What would you like to get from this group? 

#### Part II: Show and Tell

Demonstrations of code you're developing, sharing stuff you've made. 

On Discord, we use screen sharing in video chat, and in-person we do them with our own laptops.

#### Part III: Roundtable Discussions

These topics tend to emerge during Parts I and II naturally, but in general these are ways you can initiate conversations in the meeting and the Discord.

* What are you stuck on?
* What is a topic you're interested in lately?
* What interesting news caught your eye lately?
* What games have grabbed your attention?
